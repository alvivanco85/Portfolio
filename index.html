            <p> I am a fun, energetic person who likes speding time with family, traveling and trying new experiences.  
                I am currently in the field of porperty management and currently working for Barrett Property Management Inc. My passion
                and expertise in the customer service field has helped me achieve my desired role as lead of the "Short Term Property Rentals" 
                division of the company. My time with Barrett Property Management has been a great opportunity, an amazing experience
                and has taught me so many new things about the property management field. I am sad to be leaving this field in order to 
                persue new income avenues and to write a new chapter in life, but know it is for the best.
            </p>
            <p> My passion of wanting to learn new things has always been a driving force in making changes and this 
                has led me down the path of webdevelopment. I am currently learning and am well on my way on becoming a full-stack web developer. I am learning 
                all I can about this field and look forward to master these new skils. I will do whatever it takes to make sure I gradutate 
                from the course. I am excited to start looking for new opportunities in this field and also looking forward to what the future might
                bring. I believe that there is no limit to what you can do when you set your mind to it.
