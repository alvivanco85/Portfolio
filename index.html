            <p> I am a fun, energetic person who likes speding time with family, traveling and trying new experiences.  
                I am currently in the field of porperty management and working for Barrett Property Management Inc. My passion
                and expertise in the customer service field has helped me achieve my desired role as lead of the short term property rentals 
                division of the company. My time with Barrett Property Management has been a great opportunity and an amazing experience
                which has taught me so many new things about the property management field. I am sad to be leaving this field in order to 
                persue new income avenues and to write a new chapter in life.
            </p>
            <p> My passion of wanting to learn new things has always been a driving force in making changes in life and this 
                has led me down the path of webdevelopment. I am currently learning and am well on my way on becoming a full-stack web developer. 
                I am learning all I can about this field and look forward to master these new skils. I will do whatever it takes 
                to make sure I gradutate from the course. I am excited to start looking for new opportunities in this field and also looking 
                forward to what the future might bring. I believe that there is no limit to what you can do when you set your mind to it.
