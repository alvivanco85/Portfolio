            <p> I am a passionate problem solver with more than 15 years of customer service
                experience. Always, willing to go that extra mile to help people feel 100%
                satisfied with the service they receive. Fluent in Spanish but also in interpersonal
                skills. I love to help and always do so with a smile. "Because life is always
                changing, so should you!" is my motto
            </p>
            <p> My passion for learning new things has always been a driving force in making changes in life and this 
                has led me down the path of webdevelopment. I am currently learning and am well on my way on becoming a full-stack web developer. 
                I am learning all I can about this field and look forward to master these new skils and putting in the work to do so. 
                I am excited to start looking for new opportunities in webdevelopment and also looking 
                forward to what the future might bring. I believe that there is no limit to what you can do when you set your mind to it.
